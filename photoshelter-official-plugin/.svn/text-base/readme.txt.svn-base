Embed your PhotoShelter content (single images, gallery cover images, or slideshows) directly into your blog - without leaving WordPress!

== Description ==

The PhotoShelter Official Plugin allows you to embed single images or gallery slideshows from PhotoShelter into any blog post. PhotoShelter is a powerful photo sharing tool that gives you everything you need to display, distribute and sell photos online - www.photoshelter.com.

## Plugin Features
* Embeds any publicly visible PhotoShelter image or gallery slideshow directly into a blog post without leaving WordPress
* Eliminates the need to create and upload individual low-resolution files to WordPress. Your original PhotoShelter images are automatically resized, sharpened and (if you choose) watermarked for blog use. This process takes place on the fly at PhotoShelter, so the embedded images take up no space on your web server
* Embedded images click through to the same image on the your PhotoShelter website, where blog visitors can buy prints, products or digital downloads
* Creates backlinks to your PhotoShelter website so search engines like Google can easily find your photos
* Supports SEO best practices by automatically writing the IPTC image description into the ALT text of the embedded image. Get even better SEO by enabling the image caption option
* Embed images as either HTML (for mobile compatibility) or Flash (for higher security)
* Search for images by IPTC keyword or by gallery
* Supports gallery slideshow custom presets

= I'm getting a scary error message when I attempt to install the plugin. =
Most likely this is because you have a previous instance of the PhotoShelter plugin (i.e. the one developed by Graph Paper Press in 2009) that allowed you to add images to your blog posts. Try uninstalling the previous version of the plugin and reinstalling the new version. If problems persist, contact us: https://www.photoshelter.com/contact
